# Phonebook App:
- Develops a contacts management application allowing users to add and filter contacts.
- **Step 1**: Implements adding contacts and displaying a list of contacts with names.
- **Step 2**: Extends functionality to include phone numbers for contacts.
- **Step 3**: Adds a search field for filtering contacts by name, making it case-insensitive.
- **Step 4**: Refactors the application by dividing it into distinct components: form for adding contacts, contact list, contact list item, and search filter.
- **Step 5**: Enhances user experience by preventing the addition of duplicate contacts and displaying an alert message to warn the user.
- **Step 6**: Expands functionality to allow users to delete existing contacts from the phonebook.

## Criteria Met:
- Utilizes React as the foundational framework for both projects.
- Provides links to the source code and live working pages on GitHub Pages for each task.
- Ensures error-free execution of the code without any warnings in the console.
- Organizes components in separate files within the 'src/components' directory.
- Implements clear prop passing to components and maintains a clean and understandable codebase.

These project demonstrates a structured approach to solving React-based assignments, showcasing component-based development and adherence to best practices in React.
